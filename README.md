# SIMPLE SJF simulator

This repository is a simple shortest job first simulator (SJF). SJF is one of the scheduling processes that a computer might use to schedule the processing of the processes by a CPU.

## GETTING STARTED

To successfully run the project, you need to clone the project on your local machine and then open the project in your file explorer. Navigate into the folder and find the **SJF_simulation.exe**.

Open this executable file which shall open the actual application.

## MAKING CHANGES

To recreate or even make changes to this project, you need to set up your environment for development using Qt as that is the environment used by the developer.
[https://www.qt.io/](https://www.qt.io/)

The project is also developed in C++. Downloading Qt allows you to develop the application without need for finding a separate compiler for the C++ code because compilation, debugging, designing and building can all be done within Qt creator.

To learn more about Qt and how it works, you could use any youtube material on this topic, book covering this topic, [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or the official [Qt documentation](https://www.qt.io/developers#documentation) - take your pick.

## FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS

This project is an unlicenced open sourced project and therefore you could use any part of it as it is purely for educational purposes and the developer will be making some changes to it in the future in the endeavor of learning more about desktop development and you're open to contribute, review and give feedback to the project through any channels you'd like as seen in the developer's profile.

#### HAPPY CODING!
